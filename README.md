## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned about CSS Grid and how to use grid-template-areas for arrange grid items

### Continued development

I had a lot of funt with CSS grid. I would like to do more grid layouts.

Getting the correct line spacing and padding on the heading and grid cards was harder than I thought. I want to experiment more with how to get the correct spacing based on the design image I have--and on this note, I also want to practice copying design images to get a more exact match than I have in this project (I wanted to move on and keeep learning, rather than spend more time getting every measurement exact)
